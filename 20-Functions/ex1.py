# Functions:In Python, the function is a block of code defined with a name.
# We use functions whenever we need to perform the same task multiple times without writing the same code again.


# Function improves efficiency and reduces errors because of the reusability of a code.
# Once we create a function, we can call it anywhere and anytime.
# The benefit of using a function is reusability and modularity.


# Types of Functions: There are two types of functions
# 1).Built-in function
# 2).user defined function


# # 1).Built-in function:
# The functions which are come along with Python itself are called a built-in function or predefined function.
# Some of them are listed below.
# range(), id(), type(), input(), eval() , print()etc.

l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
print(l)
print(min(l))
print(max(l))
print(sum(l))
# 1
